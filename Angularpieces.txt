Angular pieces

Modules	-- containers for your app, can be nested
Config -- config options, so you can inject params
Routes -- navigate, and set up controllers and templates
Views -- what you see
$scope -- glue between view and controller
Controller -- what the view can use to show stuff
Directive -- create custom, reusable elements
Service -- common functionality (like Models!!!)
